# Persistent data for lib PTB

PTBPersistence is a Python library to deal with developed bot data persistence using lib [PTB](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot).

Developed to support multiple data storage.

Data store supported at the moment:
- MongoDB

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/HK-Mattew/ptb-persistence.git
```

Use Poetry to install.

```bash
poetry add git+https://github.com/HK-Mattew/ptb-persistence.git
```

## Usage

```python
from ptb_persistence import PTBPersistence

from ptb_persistence.datastores.mongodb import MongoDBDataStore
from telegram.ext import Application


data_store = MongoDBDataStore(
    ...
)

ptb_persistence = PTBPersistence(
    data_store=data_store
)

application = (
    Application
    .builder()
    .token("<bot-token>")
    .persistence(ptb_persistence).build()
)

```

## Support for multiple Workers/Processes
This library is designed to work well with multi-worker bots. Typically bots that run in webhook mode and use load balancers between multiple instances of the same bot.

### Conversational data persistence
Currently, PTB does not have a method like refresh_conversation_data(...). And this prevents us from working with persistent conversations across multiple workers/processes.

Here I work around this (Famous Hack) ðŸ˜„,
I created a custom Application class where I implement some logic to update conversation data. And this allows us to work with conversation data shared between multiple workers/processes.

See the custom CustomApplication class (and also more details): [Here](https://github.com/HK-Mattew/ptb-persistence/blob/main/ptb_persistence/utils/ptb.py)
